Super-resolution reconstruction model of 3D turbulent flow

A new super-resolution model, namely the turbulence volumetric super-resolution (TVSR) model, is developed based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct three-dimensional high-resolution turbulent flow field data from low-resolution data.
